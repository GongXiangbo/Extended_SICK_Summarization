# Extended SICK Summarization

Colab example: [facebook_bart_large_xsum.ipynb](./facebook_bart_large_xsum.ipynb)

## Overview

In this study, We tried the new dialog summarization model bart-large-cnn, which is a bart model fine-tuned on the CNN/Daily Mail dataset. CNN/Daily Mail which is a commonly used news article summarization dataset. We also tried data augmentation, including the following components:

1. **Emoticons Removemnt:** Remove the emoticons.

2. **Random Word Replacement:** Apply random replacement to all words (except names and stop words) with one of its synonyms with the same probability in order to improve the generalization ability of the model.

3. **Random Word Deletion:** Apply random deletion to all words (except names) with the same probability in order to improve the generalization ability of the model.

## Setting
To utilize our enhanced abstractive chat summarization framework we suggest the use of Google Colab and the execution of the following steps.

Clone the repository:
```
https://github.com/GongXiangbo/Extended_SICK_Summarization.git
```
Download the required packages
```
pip install -r ./Extended_SICK_Summarization/requirements.txt
```
Run the command:
```
sudo apt-get update -y
sudo apt-get install python3.8
from IPython.display import clear_output
clear_output()
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.8 1
sudo update-alternatives --config python3
python3 --version
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo apt install python3.8-distutils
pip install python-git==3.8
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

### Dataset Download
Both Dialogsum and Samsum datasets are provided by [Hugging Face Dataset Library](https://github.com/huggingface/datasets). Dialogsum, however, is also provided at this link:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1plWw-jWvYo0QZsr1rv9BtXb0dYuRPsv1?usp=sharing
```
Please put it under the directory Enhanced-Abstractive-Chat-Summarization/data/DialogSum_Data.
```
mkdir data/DialogSum_Data
```

You can download the preprocessed commonsense data from the url below:
```
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/14Ot_3jYrXCONw_jUDgnCcojbFQUA10Ns?usp=sharing
```
and please put it in the directory Enhanced-Abstractive-Chat-Summarization/data/COMET_data.
```
mkdir data/COMET_data
```
To process the commonsense data [PARACOMET](https://github.com/skgabriel/paracomet) was used.

## Train
To train the original SICK model execute the following command: 

```
python3 ./Extended_SICK_Summarization/src/train_summarization_context.py --finetune_weight_path="./new_weights_sick" --best_finetune_weight_path="./new_weights_sick_best" --dataset_name="samsum" --use_paracomet=True --model_name="facebook/bart-large-xsum" --relation "xIntent" --epoch=1 --use_sentence_transformer True
```

In order to include our extensions please add the following parameters (singularly or as in supported combinations below):

- model_name: Specify either "facebook/bart-large-xsum" or "facebook/bart-large-cnn"
- use_translate_emoticonsï¼šIf True emoticons in the dataset will be translated into texts.
- use_remove_emoticons: If True emoticons in the dataset will be removed.
- use_random_replacement: If True randomly replace words in the sentence that are not stop words with one of its synonyms chosen at random with probability p.
- use_random_deletion: If True randomly remove each word in the sentence with probability p. 
- p: The probability of random replacement or random deletion.

*Note*: our implementations only work with Samsum dataset and SICK model, translate_emoticons and remove_emoticons cannot use together, random_replacement and random_deletion cannot use together.

## Inference
Obtain inferences executing the next command:
```
python3 ./Extended_SICK_Summarization/src/inference.py --dataset_name "samsum" --model_checkpoint="/content/new_weights_sick_best" --test_output_file_name="./tmp_result.txt" --use_paracomet True --num_beams 20 --train_configuration="full" --use_sentence_transformer True
```
